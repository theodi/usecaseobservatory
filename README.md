todo:
* check with DD about colours - kinda done
* min width of scrollable text should be adaptive, at least for landing
* in fact, need to ensure mobile works well. maybe responsive so that under 1024px, image goes on top
^ also under 768px, need to get rid of grid. just have small image in container and underneath scrollable text container
^ under 1440px should probably examine landing page container (column-3-6) width
* home button on nav page to go back to landing
* get analytics stuff from David
* clean css and js out completely
