# Showcasing the real-world impacts of open data

Over the last decade, open data practices have matured from simple data publishing to a [spectrum of data-sharing solutions](https://theodi.org/insights/tools/the-data-spectrum/) that each function to the benefit of the wider technological ecosystem. 

The potential benefits of open data are well-documented; research at the Open Data Institute (ODI) and beyond has explored how well-designed open data sharing can bring accountability, transparency and trust.

However, despite the growing importance of open data, measuring its impact is challenging and there is a relative lack of information about how open data has delivered change and its significance for individuals, organisations and institutions around the world. 

This information is important, especially considering the ever-growing significance of open data in the current AI revolution. Open data from organisational and governmental sources can be combined to build the training corpora for AI models, which would in turn provide the models with up-to-date, factual information with known provenance. Additionally, open data can be explored and analysed to find actionable insights about the problems facing the global population, thereby revealing where technology and AI can be applied for societal good.

For these effects to be realised, developers and practitioners need to be made aware of the true benefits of open data - not only its potential, but also how it has brought impact and changed both businesses and livelihoods worldwide.

We sought to do this by building this website. The Open Data Use Case Observatory is a collection of 15 case studies from across subject matters and applications, each of which presents a unique usage of open data that had real-world impact. 

## The Open Data Use Case Observatory
When working on the Observatory, we kept a focus on data that conformed to [the ODI’s definition of open data](https://theodi.org/what-we-do/consultancy-and-products/open-data/). While this excluded ‘publicly available data’ - data that is published online without explicit open permissions regarding its use - this focus allowed us to explore not only how specific open data resources led to impact, but also how the infrastructure behind them enabled success.

With this in mind, we determined the three themes that we would conform to as we looked for case studies to populate the observatory. We have curated a series of case studies that demonstrate how open data:
* allows us to tackle society’s biggest challenges through valuable correlations across datasets, 
* spurs innovation, driving the creation of new companies and fostering collaboration among organisations, and
* brings benefits to businesses.

Over months of in-depth desk research and interviews with open data publishers and users, we assembled the 15 case studies presented here. The Observatory encompasses a broad range of subject matters, modalities and geographies. Importantly, we paid close attention to the intricacies of each dataset and how each intricacy enabled the datasets to be used for impact, whether that came from use in the training of AI models or in other technological, data-led interventions.
