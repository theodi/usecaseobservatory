# Methodology

The Open Data Use Case Observatory was developed over a period of six months from August 2024 to February 2025\. 

We began by defining our objectives and selection criteria for the case studies, which involved a series of collaborative workshop sessions between the ODI and Microsoft teams. The objectives of the case studies inform the case study selection criteria. The case studies we selected seek to demonstrate how: 

* Open data allows us to tackle society’s biggest challenges through valuable correlations across datasets.   
* Open data spurs innovation, driving the creation of new companies and fostering collaboration among organisations.  
* Open data brings benefits to businesses.

We selected the case studies for the observatory across different geographies, data types, sectors and collection methodologies, looking at their impact and whether they had previously featured in other case studies.  

## Populating the observatory  
We began by defining the case study criteria, including a schema of key information needed for each one, including information about the datasets, the uses and the impact.

We then conducted initial landscape research to populate a long list of potential case studies for the Observatory. This phase consisted of desk research, exploring academic papers and grey literature, as well as looking through dataset repositories and attending conferences and events to find new examples of open data. We also conducted exploratory interviews with experts in the field of open data, to learn about their perceptions of the world of open data, and any particular examples of good practice they had come across. For each initiative included on the longlist, we included basic information about the use case, including geography and data type. 

From this longlist, we selected a shortlist of 15 case studies to include in the Observatory. This process was conducted in collaboration with the Microsoft team, and used the selection criteria mentioned above to ensure we included a broad range of different use cases. Additional research was required for each case study, including desk research and interviews (where possible). Using information from the initiatives’ websites, and other literature on the use case, we could then fill the gaps through a series of structured interviews. Finally, we drafted the case studies, which were reviewed by those we interviewed from each initiative. 

## Limitations   
At the ODI, we want to create a world where data works for everyone. Diversity, equity and inclusion is an important part of how we do research, and we strive to ensure that all our research adheres to these principles. In practice, this means ensuring that we seek to engage with a diversity of perspectives, and take an inclusive approach to research. We may not always achieve these aims, but we strive to improve on this work in every project. 

While we successfully secured interviews with many of the initiatives included in these organisations, we were unable to speak with those working on other initiatives. Therefore, in some cases, we were unable to include certain initiatives due to a lack of publicly available information about them.
