# About

The Open Data Use Case Observatory was created by Joe Massey, Neil Majithia, Elena Simperl, Josh D’Addario (ODI) and Jennifer Hansen (Microsoft), with the support of Julie King (ODI), Sonia Cooper, Yael Morrison and Precious Aghahowa (Microsoft). This research was conducted from August 2024 to February 2025\.

The Open Data Use Case Observatory was created in partnership between the Open Data Institute (ODI) and Microsoft. [The ODI and Microsoft have partnered since 2020](https://theodi.org/what-we-do/commercial-partnerships/microsoft/) with the aim of advancing the cause of open, trustworthy data sharing and collaboration and to help address the looming ‘data divide’ so that any organisation, of any size, can more easily collaborate around data and realise the benefits.

The [ODI](https://theodi.org/) is a dynamic nonprofit company founded in 2012 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Sir Nigel Shadbolt. Its vision is to create a world where data works for everyone. The ODI builds an open, trustworthy data ecosystem, collaborating with businesses, governments and civil society to generate social and economic value. It equips leaders with data skills, shapes public policy, and influences global data-enabled initiatives through training, expert consultancy, and applied research.
