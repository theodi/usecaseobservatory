# Empowering consumers to make informed decisions about solar panels using open data

The world is racing against time to stop global temperatures from reaching 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, making the transition to renewable energy more critical than ever before. Since the industrial revolution, fossil fuels have dominated the energy mix, and their use has had a significant impact on the climate crisis: three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to the burning of fossil fuels for energy. Meanwhile, renewable energy is being harnessed through wind farms, hydroelectric dams, solar panels and more, paving the way towards a more sustainable future. Renewable energy sources currently account for one-seventh of global energy supply, according to [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy), and their use has risen rapidly over the past 10 years. 

Solar energy is a unique source of renewable energy because individual households can harness it themselves. According to [research by UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/definitions/how-is-solar-power-generated#:~:text=UC%20Davis\)-,The%2070%20percent%20of%20solar%20energy%20the%20Earth%20absorbs%20per,the%20world%20for%20one%20year), the Earth receives enough sunlight in just one hour to meet the electricity demands of every human being for a year. However, there is still a long way to go to harness that energy. Here in the UK, there are approximately [1.3 million solar panels](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/solar-panels/), which account for approximately 4.1% of total households. Additionally, there are an estimated 1,000 commercial solar farms. In 2023, [solar energy accounted for 4.9% of energy generation in the UK](https://www.neso.energy/news/britains-electricity-explained-2023-review). Others are further ahead: [China is a world leader in solar energy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/11/china-building-twice-as-much-wind-and-solar-power-as-rest-of-world-report) and installed more solar panels between March 2023 and March 2024 than in the previous three years combined \- and more than the rest of the world combined in 2023\.

While prices of solar panels are consistently reducing ([down 60% since 2010](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1001896/uk-rooftop-solar-panel-behavioural-research.pdf)), they are still a significant investment for many households, and the UK’s famously rainy and cloudy weather doesn’t lend itself to harnessing sunlight. There are many factors for households to consider when installing solar panels, including roof exposure to sunlight, long-term cost savings from generating energy and selling it back to the grid, potential government subsidies, and more. Potential adopters often lack the tools to make confident decisions about whether solar panels would benefit their home. 

## Simplifying cost calculations for solar panels  
[Solar Wizard](https://solarwizard.org.uk/), a tool to calculate the potential to generate electricity from rooftop solar panels on any building in England, Scotland or Wales, addresses this gap by turning complex data into accessible information for consumers. Solar Wizard was developed in 2024 by the [Centre for Sustainable Energy](https://www.cse.org.uk/) (CSE), an independent national charity established in 1979\. 

Solar Wizard combines open and closed data to provide insight into the potential cost of solar panels for a given household or area. The tool [models](https://solarwizard.org.uk/about-solar-wizard/how-does-solar-wizard-work) the shape of a building's roof, as well as those of the buildings and landscape features nearby, to estimate how much solar energy a roof can produce. To complete the picture, it then uses statistics from real-world installations and benchmarks to calculate the costs of installing and potential savings over time. Importantly, CSE makes it clear that the tool has [some limitations](https://solarwizard.org.uk/about-solar-wizard/model-limitations): while it provides a reasonable estimate of the cost of installing solar panels, it may not be the exact figure quoted by a solar installer. The purpose of the tool is to give an estimation of a roof's potential to allow a building owner to decide whether it would be feasible to explore installing solar panels in more detail. Also, despite accounting for shade on rooftops caused by other buildings, the tool does not account for shade provided by all trees and lampposts.

The tool was developed for two main user groups. The first is the public: households can enter their address information to receive a simple summary of how much energy solar panels on their roof could generate, how much they may cost to install, and how quickly they could make up installation costs through savings on their energy bills.

The second user group is local authorities, which can use Solar Wizard to understand the viability of solar panels for all buildings within their area and assess how solar energy could benefit their climate emergency responses. Initially started through a partnership with [Birmingham City Council](https://www.cse.org.uk/research-consultancy/consultancy-projects/mapping-birminghams-solar-pv-potential/), CSE has now rolled it out with four additional local authorities, and there is significant interest from others. A small price charged to the councils supports the wider cost of hosting the tool. 

From council usage, benefits are shared with the public. Local councils can use Solar Wizard to conduct analysis of buildings on any street, and run financial modelling to understand the relevant costs of solar panel installation over time for local businesses as well as for council investment. They can then engage with local businesses and community groups to understand the potential for solar energy and encourage collective solar purchasing schemes like [Solar Together](https://solartogether.co.uk/landing). 

## About the data  
Solar Wizard combines a variety of datasets to calculate the potential to generate solar energy for different buildings. It uses openly available LiDAR data from [England](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/f0db0249-f17b-4036-9e65-309148c97ce4/national-lidar-programme#licence-info), [Scotland](https://remotesensingdata.gov.scot/) and [Wales](https://lle.gov.wales/catalogue/item/LidarCompositeDataset/?lang=en), published under an Open Government License v3.0, alongside open solar radiation data from the European Science Hub. It additionally uses Ordnance Survey Data for building outlines and for address searching. As this data is not openly licensed, CSE pays for access. While other, open, sources of data were considered,such as OpenStreetMap, they did not have the required data quality to be used in this tool. The use and licensing of the data from Ordnance Survey was one of the main challenges faced when creating this tool, due to its ramifications on the ability of CSE to share the final dataset openly. This is a further reason for working with councils, which can [publish the full maps](https://solarwizard.org.uk/birmingham), including all Ordnance Survey data openly, thanks to the [Public Sector Geospatial License](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/customers/public-sector/public-sector-licensing).

The [software](https://github.com/cse-bristol/solar-wizard-model) for Solar Wizard is shared openly under a [Reciprocal Public License v1.5](https://github.com/cse-bristol/solar-wizard-model/blob/main/LICENSE) on GitHub.

## Looking forward  
Solar Wizard is currently in its first iteration, and there are still improvements that the team at CSE would like to make. While the tool is mostly financially sustainable now, they’d like to find a model to enable long-term financial sustainability, including the ability for updates to the service. Throughout the development of the tool, there was significant collaboration and consultation, which has left additional improvements outstanding. For example, they would like to continue exploring how to use more open data sources, how they might be able to fill in some of the gaps in the data (the LiDAR data is particularly patchy in some areas, which affects its ability to work with some local authorities), as well as improving data sources and the model itself, by including the impact of grid constraints, how government grants could affect the payback period, and the impact of batteries and electric vehicles on the long-term costs.

Open data plays a key role in Solar Wizard, which supports people to make informed decisions about solar panels, and ultimately contributes towards reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. In the future, tools like Solar Wizard, or [Haezoom](http://www.haezoom.com/), a similar tool from South Korea, may be integrated with other open data tools to enable a richer understanding of renewable energy opportunities for people around the world.
