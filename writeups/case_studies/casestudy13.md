# From Spreadsheets to Stories in the Open Data Era

Journalism is the art and science of gathering, compiling and presenting news via various forms of mass media. It’s a form of sharing information and facts, typically from an objective perspective, with a commitment to accuracy and education. According to some reports, the first instance of ‘journalism’ as a concept [dates back to 1476](https://ccea.org.uk/downloads/docs/Support/Fact%20File%3A%20AS/2019/History%20of%20Print%20Journalism%20in%20the%20UK%20and%20Ireland%20-%20AS%20Fact%20File.pdf), when the first printing press emerged. Over the past 200 years, journalism has changed to adapt to the different media it is shared through, from newspapers and magazines to TV and radio to the digital ecosystem we experience today across web pages, social media, podcasts and more. 

Data plays a huge role across every industry in every country, and journalism is no different. Data has always been a key part of telling the story of what is happening around the world, with GDP figures describing a country's economic performance and waiting list numbers clarifying how a national healthcare system is supporting its population. Today, journalists have access to an increasingly large quantity of data, on many different topics.

This data can be collected from a variety of different sources. In some cases, the data is published openly online, either from governments, multinational organisations (like the UN or the World Bank), organisations that publish data openly (like [Open Corporates](https://opencorporates.com/)), or even data leaks (like the [WarDiaries by Wikileaks](https://wardiary.wikileaks.org/)). In an era where [access to privately-held data for research and journalism is becoming increasingly restricted](https://medium.com/odi-research/we-must-fix-researcher-access-to-data-held-by-platforms-9084de211854), access to data through alternative sources is crucial for certain investigations. In these cases, alternative access methodologies like FoI requests, and in some cases data scraping, can be used.

Analysing and presenting this data in an engaging format, often through data visualisations, is a key part of translating data into insights for news articles, images and videos. Organisations like the Guardian (UK), the New York Times and the Washington Post (US), and Rappler (Philippines), have long been at the forefront of efforts to use data to tell stories. However, data journalism is a very open profession, and anyone with access to data, and knowledge of how to use it, can publish their analyses or visualisations. For some, the term ‘data journalism’ is misleading, as the [use of data is a prerequisite of journalism in the 21st century](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/explainers/what-is-data-journalism/). Nonetheless, under this umbrella term, data is used to tell the stories of the world. 

## The stories told through data  
Data journalism has been used to report on many different stories from around the world. Below are a few examples of some of the different ways journalists have used open data to tell stories about the climate crises, pandemics, sports, and more.

In 2020, the world came to a standstill as the Covid-19 pandemic spread around the globe. As many were stuck in their homes through varying degrees of lockdowns, we were inundated with data about the pandemic. Each day, new numbers were launched, keeping the public up-to-date on the number of cases, tests, vaccines, and deaths. The Covid-19 pandemic was therefore [a crucial moment in bringing data journalism into the mainstream](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500\(21\)00178-3/fulltext). Teams analysed and visualised the spread of the pandemic, developed explainers about the virus, and investigated government spending and medical supply chains. The Financial Times investigation ‘[Covid-19: The global crisis — in data](https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-global-data/)’ used open data from across national governments dashboards, as well as other aggregators such as the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) and [The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/). This piece, and others like it, demonstrate the potential for data analysis and visualisation to cut through a complex topic and provide the reader with the relevant facts to aid their understanding. 

The climate crisis is another complex issue in which many different stories, people and places are intertwined. Data journalism projects cut through the masses of data about the different strands of the climate crisis, and can convey powerful messages. ‘[Follow the Oil](https://www.followtheoil.org/follow-the-oil)’ uses open data from the [Louisiana Department of Natural Resources](https://sonlite.dnr.state.la.us/ords/apex/r/coast_man/office-of-coastal-management-permittrak-system/search-coastal-use-permit-database) and [SONRIS](http://sonris-www.dnr.state.la.us/gis/agsweb/IE/JSViewer/index.html?TemplateID=181) to map oil and gas extraction in Louisiana through wells, canals, and pipeline permits. This project helps the reader to link this extraction, and the companies involved in each location, to the multiple ecological crises that have occurred on Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, including one of the fastest rates of coastal erosion in the world. Another project, ‘[The Green Divide](https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2022/03/urban-heat-island-tree-cover/)’, visualises the connection between shaded areas in New Zealand with wealth inequality. Using data from Auckland Council, Justin Morgenroth, EHINZ, the team demonstrated how those with higher wealth levels live in the ‘leafy suburbs’ with higher levels of shade \- a privilege in an ever-warming world. 

Organisations are emerging that aim to use data to inform people about the stories that affect their lives. One example, [El Centro de Investigación Periodística (CIPER)](https://www.ciperchile.cl/), is a nonprofit foundation based in Chile dedicated to promoting and practicing investigative journalism. CIPER seeks to identify, expose or highlight failures of government, ultimately holding them to account and building legitimacy by helping governments meet the standards of public expectation. CIPER regularly draws on open [company data](https://www.ciperchile.cl/2025/01/08/rendiciones-al-servel-sociedad-del-dueno-de-sin-filtros-facturo-291-millones-por-servicios-para-campanas-de-sus-panelistas-orrego-y-poduje/) and [political records from government departments](https://www.ciperchile.cl/2024/10/24/en-los-ultimos-cuatro-anos-258-alcaldes-y-829-concejales-viajaron-con-fondos-publicos-dentro-del-pais-y-al-exterior/) to report on public interest cases, including lobbying, public use of funds, and cronyism. 

## Looking forward   
In an era where more and more people are accessing news on social media, new forms of journalism are crucial in ensuring that the public has access to verified information across a broad range of topics. Stories told using data cut through the noise, presenting information in a clear and accessible way. Ensuring that journalists continue to have access to data is an important part of continuing to hold governments, companies and civil society accountable. The landscape of access to data is continually changing, and while governments may have requirements to publish data openly, other organisations do not. Therefore, there is a continued need to publish data openly, from all types of organisations and institutions, to ensure that they are transparent and accountable to the people, communities and environment that they represent.
