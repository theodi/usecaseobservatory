# The Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem makes Earth observation data open and accessible to everyone

From tracking devastating [wildfires in Greece](https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/list-of-components/EMSR648) to [monitoring urban growth](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/ba) in rapidly growing Asian cities, a constellation of satellites circle over Earth, gathering critical data about the planet, its environment and its people.

Using these satellites, with different sensors and instruments, and in different orbits, meteorologists can measure weather patterns in near-real time, disaster responders can monitor flooding events through cloud cover, and conservationists can map deforestation over time.

What was once exclusive to space agencies, governments and wealthy corporations is now freely available to everyone – from environmental scientists and urban planners to farmers and app developers. This democratization of space-based data is driving innovation and enabling solutions to some of our most pressing global challenges.

## Enabling access to earth observation for all
One of the largest networks of satellites, [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en), represents the world's most ambitious Earth observation programme. Providing free and open data, Copernicus is transforming how we understand and respond to a changing planet. Launched by the European Union in partnership with the European Space Agency in 2014, Copernicus has revolutionised the accessibility of Earth observation data. 

At its core, Copernicus consists of two major components: a space segment comprising a fleet of dedicated satellites called [Sentinels](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/about-copernicus/infrastructure/discover-our-satellites), and a service segment that transforms raw data into actionable information. The programme monitors six key areas: atmosphere, marine environment, land, climate change, emergency management, and security. Each Sentinel satellite is designed with specific missions in mind. [Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1)'s radar imaging penetrates cloud cover to monitor sea ice, oil spills, terrain and vegetation, [Sentinel-2](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel-2) monitors crops and natural habitats, while [Sentinel-3](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-3) measures sea surface topography and temperature, and [Sentinel-5P](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-5p) specialises in atmospheric composition monitoring.

Copernicus has built an entire [Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/#/) (CDSE) to make satellite data from Sentinel missions open and accessible to all. Data is not solely hosted and shared openly, but Copericus has also built environments to explore and analyse the data online via their free cloud servers. CDSE is used by academics, startups, and government agencies, and has a rapidly growing user base. Copernicus data has become a critical part of how we understand the world, and is now [used more than Google’s Earth Engine](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/copernicus-data-space-ecosystem_earthobservation-copernicus-sentinelhub-activity-7267195289348767746-7hPa?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). The programme's impact spans multiple sectors: 

* During the Covid-19 pandemic, Copernicus data [helped authorities monitor changes in air pollution and economic activity](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/flawed-estimates-effects-lockdown-measures-air-quality-derived-satellite-observations).   
* When natural disasters strike, emergency responders use [near-real-time imagery to coordinate relief efforts](https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/ems/emergency-management-service-mapping).   
* Farmers in Morocco [leverage vegetation indices](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/use-cases/an-expert-system-for-crop-monitoring-and-yield-forecasting-in-morocco) to optimise crop management.  
* Climate scientists use decades of archived data to [study long-term environmental changes](https://climate.copernicus.eu/).  
* [School teachers use Copernicus Browser](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/news/2024-9-2-back-school-copernicus-browser-education) to show locations and processes of interest to their class.

## About the data
Copernicus generates an enormous amount of Earth observation data – currently more than 25 terabytes per day. This data is made available through multiple access points, as well as incorporated into different products available online. Copernicus is more than just an open data portal. It hosts an entire ecosystem for the access, exploration and analysis of Copernicus data. This includes the open Browser, a scheme of Application Programming Interfaces (API-s) to make the data analysis accessible within user-generated code, a codebase with tutorials, and free virtual machine capacity including a Jupyter Lab for prototyping. 

Copernicus stewards data in lots of different forms, including raw satellite imagery in multiple spectral bands, processed geophysical parameters (for example, sea surface temperature or soil moisture) and derived products (such as land cover maps and air quality forecasts), as well as historical archives dating back to the programme's inception. The data is of extremely high quality and consistency, and regular calibration and validation ensures that measurements remain reliable and comparable over time. The programme's commitment to standardisation means that data products follow well-documented formats and metadata standards, making them easily usable across different platforms and applications.

Importantly, Copernicus, as a publicly funded EU programme, requires a [unique licence for its data](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/documents/247904/690755/Sentinel_Data_Legal_Notice). This licence provides instructions on attribution and waives copyright for all legal usage of the data.   

## Looking forward
The future potential of Copernicus data extends far beyond its current applications. The vast repository of standardised Earth observation data provides an ideal training ground for [AI models](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/use-cases). These could automate the detection of environmental changes, predict natural disasters, or optimise resource management at unprecedented scales. In practice, this means developing new and integrating existing APIs with the current infrastructure, to enable interoperability. 

Copernicus wants to make this data available to use for AI training more broadly. [CREODIAS](https://creodias.eu/background/) has developed a paid-for AI offering, which means its users are mostly limited to governments and large businesses. As per the terms of Copernicus, it is seeking to make this data and infrastructure available to all, so that anyone can benefit from the power of satellite data. As Copernicus enters its next phase of development, with new satellites and capabilities planned, its role as a cornerstone of global environmental monitoring and decision-making will only grow.
