# Mapping Global Trade's Hidden Environmental Cost Through Open Data Integration

The global ecosystem relies on millennia-old rainforests for climate regulation and overall biodiversity. However, human activity over the last few centuries has reduced [the size of these habitats](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/global/), with trees cut down for construction materials and the agricultural land degraded beneath them. This deforestation risks irreversible climate change and the destruction of habitats for endangered animals, and, at its core, is significantly [motivated by the growth of international trade in commodities](https://www.carbonbrief.org/scientists-calculate-trade-related-deforestation-footprint-of-rich-countries/).

This is despite the [pledges of governments](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59088498) and corporations worldwide to put an end to deforestation. Because the complicated networks of global supply chains obscure whether individual producers and exporters of commodities, such as palm oil or soy beans, are involved in the cutting down and removal of trees, their trading partners may be unwittingly linked to deforestation. 

[Trase](https://trase.earth/about), a not-for-profit initiative founded in 2015 by the Stockholm Environment Institute and Global Canopy, aims to counteract this problem by introducing transparency to the links between global trade and deforestation via their openly released data, information and intelligence regarding commodity supply chains. Their releases are the products of months of work analysing open and closed data sources to build insights on commodities such as [Brazilian beef](https://trase.earth/explore/supply-chain/brazil/beef?chartType=sankey&year=2020&indicator=volume&dimension=region_production_1&dimension=exporter_group&dimension=importer&dimension=country_of_destination&hideDomestic=false) or [Indonesian palm oil](https://trase.earth/explore/supply-chain/indonesia/palm-oil?chartType=sankey&year=2022&indicator=volume&dimension=region_production_1&dimension=mill_group&dimension=exporter&dimension=country_of_import&hideDomestic=false) to paint a picture of their supply chains’ impacts on forests.

Trase brings accountability to global trade by informing governments, financial institutions, and goods manufacturers how they are indirectly contributing to deforestation via their choices of trade partners, investments, and raw materials suppliers. This gives them more informed engagement with actors in their supply chains and implement policies to aid the global transition to a sustainable world. 

## Using data to tackle deforestation  
When working on a specific commodity like Brazilian beef, the Trase team first purchases trade records from trade intelligence platforms and uses them to identify the exporters associated with that commodity. These trade records are then linked with open data sources on commodity processing, storage and transport within the producing country to identify the most likely sourcing regions for a given shipment. Then, by linking this data with open satellite imagery on deforestation, the team can analyse how different consumer markets, individual organisational actors, and the facilities of those actors, may be contributing to deforestation.

This process of course varies per country and per commodity, depending on the amount of data available. In most cases, Trase relies on statistical methods and [material flow analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/material-flow-analysis) to fill in gaps, while a significant amount of the analysis of data sources is done manually. The results of this work include open data offerings, business intelligence, advisory services, and public-facing reports on more than 20 types of commodities exported from 10 countries where international trade is a major driver of deforestation. 

These outputs have been used by a number of organisations, including goods manufacturers, financial institutions, governments, journalists and NGOs. For example, following a recommendation by the Norwegian Council on Ethics, Norges Bank Investment Management used Trase’s findings as evidence when placing Marfrig, a meat trading company, under observation [because of the risk of driving deforestation via its suppliers in Brazil](https://www.nbim.no/en/the-fund/news-list/2021/decisions-on-observation-and-exclusion2/). 

Trase data was also [used in a report to regulators in Germany](https://www.clientearth.org/latest/press-office/press-releases/german-authorities-urged-to-investigate-top-three-meat-companies-over-human-rights-risks-in-brazil/) concerning German soy imports from the country and their likely effects on deforestation. This concluded that the German meat industry (which uses Brazilian soy to feed livestock) is not doing enough to address this risk.

Similarly, Trase [worked with a group of luxury fashion brands](https://trase.earth/insights/understanding-soy-deforestation-risk-in-leather-products) to help them understand how their supply chains were indirectly exposed to deforestation in Brazil and how this conflicts with their organisational commitments to the environment. The team also [advised Storebrand](https://trase.earth/insights/storebrand-asset-management-deforestation-risk-assessment), an asset management company, on the deforestation risk present in their investment portfolio, and in 2022 supported the French government in its implementation of its strategy to end imports of agricultural commodities linked to deforestation.

## About the data
To have this impact, Trase relies on a range of data sources. Some closed data is purchased from trade intelligence platforms, but Trase predominantly uses open data to perform its methodologies. For example, the team uses the national statistics offices of target countries to cross-examine the trade records they buy, as well as open datasets on processing facilities (like the [Universal Mill List](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/business/certification/the-universal-mill-list/)) and company filings to identify sites of interest in a country and their organisational owners. With the addition of open geospatial data on deforestation (like [Mapbiomas](https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/en/)), which is used to identify whether the locations of sites of interest are also the locations of deforestation, the results of Trase’s work are model examples of the use of open data for real-world impact. 

Trase’s final outputs, like its [Indonesian Palm Oil dataset](https://trase.earth/open-data/datasets/supply-chains-indonesia-palm-oil), are publicly released under the [CC-BY 4.0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en), meaning any organisation could use Trase to understand how they or their industry are associated with the cutting down of global rainforests. The datasets are complex, reflecting the incredible amount of work Trase put into its research, and are not simply a republishing of the input data sources. 

## Looking forward
Trase datasets will grow and change over the next few years, with the team now looking to bring more regular updates to a consolidated core data offering on key supply chains such as Brazilian soy and Indonesian palm oil, while complementing this with more [globally consistent and comparable data](https://trase.earth/insights/deduce-new-data-to-inform-action-against-commodity-driven-deforestation) to build a more complete picture of international trade. Trase also hopes to expand its advisory capacities and partnerships with organisations around the world, aiming to follow up on the insights they publish by supporting real-world change.
