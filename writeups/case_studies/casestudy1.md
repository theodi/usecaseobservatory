# 1. Using open data to support electrification of rural areas in Uganda
Uganda, a landlocked country in East Africa, has a population of approximately 50 million people. For those living in urban areas, the electrification rate is around 60%, however, for those living in more rural settings, this rate is only 18% (although increasing). This low [electrification rate](https://www.se4all-africa.org/seforall-in-africa/country-data/uganda/) is considered a major barrier for economic development and poverty reduction.

Uganda has set themselves the goal of having more than 99% of the population with access to electricity by 2030, with 90% of that energy coming from renewable sources. Uganda is endowed with great renewable energy potential, able to generate power from solar, hydro, biomass and wind. Many rural areas are too far away from the current grid infrastructure, and so exploring alternative energy sources is a crucial step. 

Over the past two years, [Sunbird AI](https://sunbird.ai/) has been working with the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) and The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development in implementing the National Electrification Strategy (NES) to [create a strategy to electrify 10 million households by 2030 by using open data](https://sunbird.ai/portfolio/green-mini-grid-site-identification/). 

Utilising open data to develop an electrification strategy
Sunbird AI is a non-profit organisation based in Uganda that develops artificial intelligence systems for social impact in Africa. They aim to help social initiatives, public institutions and policymakers develop new AI technology for their own needs. Sunbird AI has a strong culture of collaboration and teamwork, as well as a commitment to open source and open research, so that others can build on their work. Some example projects include work to reduce noise pollution by building a map of noise data in Uganda, and another to build and develop text and speech language datasets for the six different languages in Uganda, to support the development of technology which can be used by the whole country. 

In this project, Sunbird AI focused on the Lamwo district, in northern Uganda on the border with South Sudan. Lamwo is some distance from the national grid, meaning alternative energy sources are required to electrify this region. To support decision making on types of energy sources required, Sunbird AI developed a tool to identify the optimal sites for the government to build mini-grids, and to support the wider electrification of rural areas. 

To do this, Sunbird AI used machine learning to automate the identification of optimal electrification strategies. They use a number of open data sets, including the open buildings dataset, population data, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as well as several Uganda Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development datasets. 

The tool seeks to first understand the different settlements in Lamwo. Information concerning precise details about a village, such as number of buildings and their density, is important information for selecting where to place a mini-grid. The tool further brings in demand and supply side electrification data, and is able to forecast potential expansion or reduction of buildings and settlements, to assess energy needs. 

The tool takes the form of a colour coded map of different towns. The colour coding is based on the most optimal electrification strategy across the different options including solar, biomass, wind and more. The map shows the density of buildings, their size and their proximity to other electrification options, for example, the hydroelectric power. The map provides an assessment of the most optimal electrification strategy for each town, based on this information. For example, there is one part of Lamwo which houses a protected bioreserve, certain strategies like biomass are therefore classed as unsuitable. 

Across Lamwo, the tool has helped the local government to identify the right strategy for each village. For most of Lamwo, home solar panel systems or extending the existing grid are the most suitable solution. The results of this tool are being used by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development to support the electrification of Lamwo in the most optimal way.

## About the data
The tool developed by Sunbird AI seeks to determine the best electrification strategy for individual villages in Lamwo from relevant GIS layers.

Sunbird AI analyzed several GIS datasets and derivative data from satellite imagery processed through machine learning algorithms like the open buildings dataset. Other data incorporated into the tool include population data, topography data, wind data, solar PV potential, river data, NDVI and more. Sunbird has made many of the datasets available for further download via their Github.

## Looking forward 
The work focusing on the Lamwo district is only the start of this project, and the Sunbird AI team will be working to expand the model across Uganda, enabling their mission of electrifying 10 million households by 2030. They also now have curated a rich dataset about Uganda's villages, climate and landscape, which they will use to explore developing other predictive models using the data. 

This pattern is common across Sunbird AI projects. They want to continue to work on new, applied projects to realise the value of open data for new use cases and contexts. They also want to improve and extend their existing projects into new locations. They will continue to stick to their core value of collaboration, and hope to extend the partners that they work with in the future. Sunbird AI is working on a variety of projects with a variety of partners and datasets for social impact in Uganda and beyond.
