# GitHub open data is used to understand technological innovation around the world and the impact of AI
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online platform that allows programmers to create, store, manage, and share their code publicly. As of January 2023, it had more than 100 million users across the world and is now ubiquitous in the field of open source, collaborative programming: almost anyone looking to start a project and share their code with others will turn to GitHub to host their work. 

With developers’ code from all over the world hosted publicly, GitHub can act as a central source of information regarding technology research and development. This has already been taken advantage of with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), which was one of the first AI-powered programming assistants for developers and was trained on all code that is publicly available on GitHub. GitHub Copilot was groundbreaking, and was found to [not only increase productivity of users but also increase their job satisfaction and wellbeing](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/).

However, GitHub data can be used for much more. Each repository on GitHub (and each piece of code within it) also has attached metadata: labels that are either automatically generated or written by the developer themselves that provide information about who contributed to the code, what it aims to do, what language it is written in, what technological topic it falls under, and more. This metadata is rich and can be used to build an understanding of what developers on GitHub are doing, reflecting current technological trends.

## Using data to analyse innovation and AI
GitHub aggregates metadata about repositories on GitHub into an open data offering: the [GitHub Innovation Graph](https://innovationgraph.github.com/). The Innovation Graph provides quarterly releases of indicators measured from the aggregation of GitHub metadata. This includes data on the amount of developer contributions each quarter, either globally or per country and economic bloc, as well as statistics for the licences and programming languages being used by these developers and the technological categories their contributions belong to.

First released in 2023, the Innovation Graph was designed with a collaborative effort between teams in GitHub and partners in civil society in order to ensure the open data released by the initiative was truly useful. The Innovation Graph has enabled commercial, academic, and governmental research on global innovation, especially in the context of AI.

GitHub has worked with Harvard Business School to [measure the impact of generative AI on innovation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5007084). By employing statistical methods on open Innovation Graph data linked with some closed data held by GitHub, the research team found that there was a significant increase in global productivity after the deployment of GitHub Copilot, with developers from around the world doing more work on the core functionalities of their code rather than project management activities which AI assistants can help with. Furthermore, the results suggest that the release of generative AI code assistants enabled programmers to start being more explorative in their coding activities, with this most evident amongst developers with relatively low technical ability. 

Two economics researchers similarly used Innovation Graph open data to [estimate the impact of ChatGPT at a global scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11046). Hypothesising that ChatGPT enhanced productivity and overall efficiency in software development, the researchers used time series analysis methods to compare countries in which ChatGPT has been banned to countries where it is unrestricted. This comparison yielded strong results suggesting that unrestricted access to ChatGPT in a country is significantly associated with more code being uploaded to GitHub from that country and, interestingly, a growth in software developers per capita in that country. 

Innovation Graph data can also be used in policy discussions. The Economist has reported on the [potential policy outcomes](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/09/29/ai-and-globalisation-are-shaking-up-software-developers-world) from the above research, and [other research](https://jeffgortmaker.com/files/Open_Source_Software_Policy_in_Industry_Equilibrium.pdf) has used the Innovation Graph as the basis of analysis of China’s potentially tightening internet restrictions on its future domestic innovation and software development. Each of these pieces represent the interests of software developers and demonstrate the overall dynamics of technological innovation to policymakers. 

## About the data
Innovation Graph data is entirely kept in accessible .csv files on its own GitHub repository. This means that anyone, regardless of their technical knowledge and experience with the git ecosystem, can download the data and use it for analysis. Also, the data is released under a [Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en), which means that GitHub opts out of all copyright ownership of the data thereby ensuring it has the widest possible reach. 

In the initial design phase, the GitHub team wanted to ensure that they honoured their commitment to the privacy of their userbase. They do so by always publishing data with a delay, only ever publishing aggregates of data, and never publishing data for countries with fewer than 100 developers – these measures ensure that the data preserves anonymity and mitigates the risk of re-identification of individuals in the dataset.

## Looking forward 
While the Innovation Graph team continues to update and release data, they are looking to expand their metrics and analyses to better demonstrate economic impacts of technology development and innovation. With this the data will be maximally useful for policymakers and economists looking to understand technology innovations and what they mean for the global economy. 

Also, the team is in the process of designing an update to the way they classify repositories as AI-related, hoping to be able to better capture the landscape of AI projects published and updated on GitHub. This work might involve [utilising previous research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/05/gonzalez-msr-2020.pdf) but with updated methodologies to reflect the ever-changing vernacular in the field of AI.
