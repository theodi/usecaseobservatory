# Community-Driven Open Data Strengthens Fight for Global Biodiversity

Throughout history, there have been [five mass extinction events](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/paleontology/extinction-over-time), when huge numbers of species of plants and animals disappeared in a relatively short period of time. [According to many scientists](https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/biodiversity/biodiversity/#:~:text=These%20experts%20calculate%20that%20between,2%2C000%20extinctions%20occur%20every%20year.), we are currently in the sixth mass extinction event, and this one is unique. For the first time, a single species appears to be almost wholly responsible: humans. [Biodiversity experts estimated](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fee.2536) that approximately 30% of species have been globally threatened or driven to extinction since the year 1500\. While climate change often dominates environmental headlines, the silent crisis of biodiversity loss poses an equally severe threat to Earth's ecosystems. From bees pollinating the plants we eat, to trees turning carbon dioxide into the oxygen we breathe, the complex web of life sustains the natural systems on which we depend.

Scientists sometimes say anecdotally that they have a better understanding of how many stars there are in the galaxy than how many species there are on Earth. Yet the diversity of wildlife is startling, and we have yet to scratch the surface of understanding the full breadth of life we share the planet with. Traditionally, biodiversity monitoring depends on field surveys by trained experts. These take a lot of time and effort, and simply cannot keep up with the rate of change of biodiversity. Conservation efforts are severely limited by this knowledge gap. Without comprehensive data about biodiversity patterns, conservationists struggle to make informed decisions about habitat or species protection, assess the impact of human activities, or track the success of restoration projects. 

Understanding what species exist, and where they live, is fundamental to protecting them, and new developments in technology offer a promising path forward. Especially interesting is the combination of mobile phone cameras alongside image recognition AI. With access to more photos, as well as the ability to process them, developing systems can help to bridge knowledge gaps and provide the insights needed to detect and then protect Earth's remaining biodiversity.

## Identifying plants and animals using open data  
[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) is an online community that shares wildlife observations to discuss, identify and create research-quality citizen science data for science and conservation. iNaturalist started as a student project in 2008, and in 2023 it became an independent nonprofit organisation. The platform enables people to upload photos and to tag them with specific information, such as the location where they were taken. Users then engage with the community to identify which species the flora or fauna in the photo belongs to. 

Building on iNaturalist’s original aim of bringing people and nature together, the team developed [Seek](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app), a smartphone app that uses computer vision AI to enable users to [identify the different plants and animals that they come across in nature](https://www.inaturalist.org/blog/23075-real-time-computer-vision-predictions-in-seek-by-inaturalist-version-2-0#description). The computer vision model includes 15,798 species and 12,524 broader taxonomic groups and is trained entirely on data contributed to iNaturalist. The app supports people to identify plants and animals but also supports the iNaturalist platform, continuing to contribute more images and classifications. Additionally, because the model learns as more photos are taken, its accuracy grows over time when identifying the plants that users see in their day-to-day lives. The app has become so accurate that [Seek performs better than many other image recognition tools](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10460) on flora and fauna, even beating Google Lens. 

Approaches like iNaturalist are becoming increasingly [well developed and valued](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065250418300230) in the global fight for biodiversity. iNaturalist citizen scientists have [recorded more species of fish on Australian coral reefs than would be possible by traditional methods](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359434881_Many_cameras_make_light_work_opportunistic_photographs_of_rare_species_in_iNaturalist_complement_structured_surveys_of_reef_fish_to_better_understand_species_richness) and captured images of over [400 previously unknown butterflies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354807768_%27First_Known_Photographs_of_Living_Specimens%27_the_power_of_iNaturalist_for_recording_rare_tropical_butterflies). The app even played a critical part in controlling an [outbreak of the invasive Elm Zigzag Sawfly in Canada](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4A5DAE3501F860B529AF848738842180/S0008347X21000444a.pdf/div-class-title-elm-zigzag-sawfly-span-class-italic-aproceros-leucopoda-span-hymenoptera-argidae-recorded-for-the-first-time-in-north-america-through-community-science-div.pdf). Beyond the role these initiatives play in directly supporting particular species, there is [a belief amongst experts](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-102209-144636) that these citizen science initiatives play a critical role in connecting people to nature, increasing their understanding of the natural world and our connection with it as humans. 

## About the dataset  
As of the start of 2025, iNaturalist hosted 223,922,593 observations, of 503,296 species, posted by 3,479,855 different people. Users are predominantly [based in the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/us/inaturalist-nature-app.html?unlocked_article_code=cqU99xIPlGPm2qt5dyiZSbw2MoPHL5Vsa8VQ-6AJ9VeD_MFfj-m2D8xdpC7hr3DeONjDN5LfPv4xSoAewaFP8jTo6YpHnzU1JHopwZ9-l6J4QQR181jOa2fRiMyHCbs_TgHEGNs1vprOns7WYWOigK_4Jwq8g_dg2eLLgrpfLoN_2x_pLvcbPzN0wMbXurAmwqX2455trdMLeybHrO4w_uFhBQALvaMspxiiMr0s6TAsC3mpfYJySiTn0y4bztQupz1CnTcYyAWlHy8p4qcqi4BY9AAsNL_CvWUjOQoQpqUDDg7O0htt-1wScgDI7H01vEpIjuvm_53-&smid=share-url) (40%). The dataset is entirely generated by everyday people, and is openly available for use. 

The dataset is designed to be ‘research grade’, meaning that species identification is agreed upon by community consensus and its entry in the data comes with a date, location, photo or sound clip, and confirmation that the organism isn’t captive or cultivated. The data is published on [the Global Biodiversity Information Facility website](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7) under a [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode). It is slightly smaller than the full iNaturalist catalogue, with 103,272,637 observations as of the end of 2024\. It has been downloaded 1,718,495 times and cited nearly 6,000 times in academic research. 

There are, of course, limitations to the dataset. Taking photos of animals over-represents animals that are easy to photograph, excluding lots of creepy crawlies. Photos also tend to come from more human populated areas, and are taken at certain times of day, usually when the weather is nice. Despite these challenges, citizen-generated data is an important part of the fight for biodiversity. 

## Looking forward  
There is a lot of excitement about the role that citizen science initiatives like iNaturalist can play in supporting the fight to support biodiversity. As these initiatives go from strength to strength, there is also the opportunity to combine this data with other emerging data sources, such as satellite data or acoustic monitoring, to paint a more in-depth picture of the planet’s flora and fauna. 

iNaturalist demonstrates the power of citizen science in creating new datasets. It provides inspiration for other fields and sectors to collect data that is otherwise unavailable. Particularly in the era of AI, data donation is set to become an important part of the way data is collected to tackle some of society's biggest challenges.
