# 2. Combining open and closed data to identify the effects of international trade on deforestation
The global ecosystem relies on millennia-old rainforests for climate regulation and overall biodiversity. However, human activity over the last few centuries has reduced [their size](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/global/), with trees being cut down for construction materials and the agricultural land beneath them. This deforestation risks irreversible climate change and the destruction of habitats for endangered animals, and, at its core, is [largely motivated by the growth of international trade in commodities.](https://www.carbonbrief.org/scientists-calculate-trade-related-deforestation-footprint-of-rich-countries/)

This is despite the [pledges of governments and corporations worldwide](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59088498) to put an end to deforestation; the complicated networks of global supply chains obscure whether individual producers and exporters of commodities like palm oil or soy beans are involved in the cutting down and removal of trees, meaning their trading partners may be unwittingly linked to deforestation. 

[Trase](https://trase.earth/about), a not-for-profit initiative founded in 2015 by the Stockholm Environment Institute and Global Canopy, aims to counteract this problem by introducing transparency to the links between global trade and deforestation via their openly released data, information, and intelligence regarding commodity supply chains. Their releases are the products of months of work analysing open and closed data sources to build insights on commodities such as [Brazilian beef](https://trase.earth/explore/supply-chain/brazil/beef?chartType=sankey&year=2020&indicator=volume&dimension=region_production_1&dimension=exporter_group&dimension=importer&dimension=country_of_destination&hideDomestic=false) or [Indonesian palm oil](https://trase.earth/explore/supply-chain/indonesia/palm-oil?chartType=sankey&year=2022&indicator=volume&dimension=region_production_1&dimension=mill_group&dimension=exporter&dimension=country_of_import&hideDomestic=false) to paint a picture of their supply chains’ impacts on rainforests.

As a result, Trase brings accountability to global trade, providing governments and goods manufacturers information on how they are indirectly contributing to deforestation via their choices of trade partners and raw materials suppliers, allowing them to divert trade to responsible exporters in order to aid the global transition to a sustainable world. 

Using data to tackle deforestation
When working on a specific commodity like Brazilian beef, the Trase team first purchases trade records from trade intelligence platforms and uses them to identify the main organisational actors within the country, including farm owners, intermediaries, and exporters. Then, by linking open data on these organisations with open satellite imagery, the team can then geolocate the specific farms, processing facilities, and storage locations that are involved in the supply chain of the commodity. By overlaying a map of these locations with maps of deforestation, Trase are then able to analyse how the individual facilities of each organisational actor in the production and distribution of a commodity are contributing to deforestation.

This process is of course different per country and per commodity, depending on the amount of data available. In most cases, Trase relies on statistical methods and [material flow analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/material-flow-analysis) to fill in gaps, while a significant amount of the analysis of data sources is done manually. The results of this work include open data offerings, business intelligence, advisory services, and public-facing reports on more than 20 types of commodities exported from 10 countries with rainforests at risk. 

These outputs have been used by a number of organisations, including goods manufacturers, financial institutions, governments, journalists, and NGOs. For example, following a recommendation by the Norwegian Council on Ethics, Norges Bank Investment Management used Trase’s findings as evidence when placing Marfrig, a meat trading company, under observation [because of their risk of driving deforestation via their suppliers in Brazil](https://www.nbim.no/en/the-fund/news-list/2021/decisions-on-observation-and-exclusion2/). 

Trase data was also used in a [report to regulators in Germany](https://www.clientearth.org/latest/press-office/press-releases/german-authorities-urged-to-investigate-top-three-meat-companies-over-human-rights-risks-in-brazil/) concerning German soy imports from the country and their likely effects on deforestation, making the claim that the meat industry (which uses Brazilian soy to feed livestock) in Germany is not doing enough to address this risk.

Similarly, Trase[ worked with a group of luxury fashion brands](https://trase.earth/insights/understanding-soy-deforestation-risk-in-leather-products) to help them understand how their supply chinese were indirectly exposed to deforestation in Brazil and how this conflicts with their organisational commitments to the environment. The team [also advised Storebrand](https://trase.earth/insights/storebrand-asset-management-deforestation-risk-assessment), an asset management company, on the deforestation risk present in their investment portfolio, and in 2022 supported the French government in its implementation of its strategy to end imports of agricultural commodities linked to deforestation.

## About the data
To have this impact, Trase relies on a range of data sources. Some closed data is purchased from trade intelligence platforms, but Trase predominantly uses open data to perform its methodologies. For example, the team uses the national statistics offices of their target countries to cross-examine the trade records they buy, as well as open datasets on processing facilities (like the [Universal Mill List](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/business/certification/the-universal-mill-list/)) and company filings to identify sites of interest in a country and their organisational owners. With the addition of open geospatial data on deforestation (like [Mapbiomas](https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/en/)), which is used to identify whether the locations of sites of interest are also the locations of deforestation, the results of Trase’s work are model examples of the usage of open data for real-world impact. 

Trase’s final outputs, like their [Indonesian Palm Oil dataset](https://trase.earth/open-data/datasets/supply-chains-indonesia-palm-oil), are publicly released, meaning any organisation could use Trase to understand how they themselves or their industry are associated with the cutting down of global rainforests. The datasets are complex, reflecting the incredible amount of work Trase put into their research, and are not simply a republishing of the input data sources. 

## Looking forward
Trase datasets will grow and change over the next few years, with the team now looking to build globally consistent and comparable data in order to bring full transparency to international trade. Trase also hopes to expand their advisory capacities and partnerships with organisations around the world, aiming to follow up on the insights they publish by supporting real-world change.
