# How Open Data Enables Collaboration in Humanitarian Crisis Response
According to OCHAâ€™s Centre for Humanitarian Data, the [demand for crisis data reached a record level in 2023](https://centre.humdata.org/the-state-of-open-humanitarian-data-2024/), due to the effects of climate shocks, food insecurity, war, disease, and food security around the world.  

The use of data to support humanitarian crises is not new, but the field has been rapidly evolving over the past 20 years. Access to contextual data about countries, data about crises as they happen, and the response of humanitarian action, has increased via a network of organisations that have been collecting this data. However, this data has often been siloed or not publicly accessible, making it difficult to gain a clear picture of a crisis and therefore more difficult to respond effectively. 

The open sharing of data has [enabled humanitarian actors](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/humanitarian_data_ecosystem.pdf) to become more efficient and effective, while facing more crises. [The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX)](https://data.humdata.org/) is one platform that supports data sharing in the humanitarian sector, by acting as a convener for trusted parties to share data about crises as they happen.

## Enabling collaboration in the humanitarian sector
HDX is managed by [OCHA's Centre for Humanitarian Data](https://centre.humdata.org/), which is located in The Hague, the Netherlands. OCHA is part of the United Nations Secretariat and is responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies. HDX was launched in July 2014, with the goal of making humanitarian data easy to find and use for analysis. 

As of January 2025, HDX hosts nearly 20,000 datasets from more than 2,065 sources covering more than 200 countries and territories. The platform has a series of more than 200 partner organisations sharing data, including humanitarian organisations like the World Food Programme, other multinational organisations like the World Bank Group, nonprofits like OpenStreetMap, and tech companies like Meta, which shares information from its Data for Good programme. In 2024, datasets on HDX were downloaded more than 3.4 million times by 1.45 million users. HDX data has been used to share open source maps that have been used to respond to [the earthquake in Syria and Turkey](https://opensource.com/article/23/3/open-source-open-data-humanitarian-response). The World Health Organization used data on HDX to plan polio campaigns in remote locations in [the Democratic Republic of Congo](https://centre.humdata.org/ochas-partnership-with-meta-helps-find-people-in-need/).

Sharing data via the HDX platform has had a big impact on the humanitarian sector as a whole, and has revamped how data is shared to support decision-making around crises:

* **Increasing open access to data.** Before HDX existed, humanitarian data was siloed across the huge diversity of stakeholders in the field. Accessing data required a strong knowledge of the organisations in the field, and connections to those organisations to ask for access, which meant lots of people did not know that data existed. Bringing all that data together in one place for everyone to access has been hugely valuable to the sector. It is also more cost effective for the respective organisations, as they achieve better reach when publishing on HDX than on their own platforms. 
Building trust. Only trusted organisations with relevant data are able to join HDX. The team checks every dataset added to the platform to ensure sensitive or personal data is not shared publicly. The wider team at the Centre for Humanitarian Data has rich expertise in responsible data practices, and can support many of the members to share and use data in a responsible way.
* **Enabling a coherent message**. Data published on HDX enables the stakeholders involved in tackling a crisis, from humanitarian organisations to journalists, to get on the same page with timely reliable data. The platform publishes data from more than 200 organisations that are experts in their respective fields. When numbers on the HDX platform posted by two organisations will be different, HDX does not choose which is right or wrong but ensures the metadata (the methodology) is complete so that users can choose the appropriate dataset for their analysis. In July 2024, HDX also launched the [HDX Humanitarian API (HAPI)](https://data.humdata.org/hapi), which enables users to access standardized indicators from multiple sources. Using HAPI gives users the confidence that they are using the latest data and helps them more easily perform analysis.
* **Alerting to potential new crises**. In June 2024, the Centre for Humanitarian Data launched [HDX Signals](https://data.humdata.org/signals), which monitors key datasets and generates automated emails when significant, negative changes are detected. By leveraging real-time data, advanced analytics and AI summations, HDX Signals is proving instrumental in turning data into actionable insights that can support timely allocations of funding, data-driven decision-making, and faster humanitarian response. 

## About the data
The data on the HDX platform includes datasets from back in January 2008 to current data about crises happening right now. Across the 20,000 datasets hosted on HDX, there are three main types:
* **Baseline data** provides the context of different countries to support responses to crises. It covers common reference information, like the name of districts or cities (which may vary across languages).
* **Situational data** is specific to particular crises. It includes information about the people affected and their needs. 
* **Response data** covers how different organisations are responding to each crisis to support coordination across stakeholders.

## Looking forward
HDX has already changed how the humanitarian sector responds to crises, which has ultimately improved the lives of those suffering from these crises. HDX now seeks to expand that impact by curating new data sources and by thinking about how the data can be used to help humanitarians get ahead of crises through anticipatory action.

Secondly, HDX is exploring how generative AI can support people to access and use data in a safe and trustworthy way. It wants humanitarian actors across the ecosystem to be able to use the data on HDX to inform their decision-making and to ultimately support more people suffering from crises around the world.
