# Business benefits from collaboratively sharing data across the water ecosystem
The water industry in the UK is [at a pivotal moment](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0qdev4vyl5o). The water companies are struggling against a public backlash about their role in polluting Britain's seas and rivers, meanwhile the water companies have a combined £60bn in debt which looms over them. 

Water data is part of solving this puzzle. Open data in the water industry has the potential to improve water quality, sustainability and customer outcomes. However, compared to data transformation in other sectors like the banking sector, there is a long way to go. Water companies, regulators and government departments collect a wealth of data and information relating to the water and wastewater services, which could provide insight into their effects on communities and the wider environment. This data could help improve performance in the here and now, as well as support planning for the future.

In 2023, Ofwat, the water regulator in the UK published a report titled ‘Open data in the water industry: making the change’, which [called on all water companies to take immediate action to unleash the benefits of open data](https://www.ofwat.gov.uk/ofwat-calls-on-water-companies-to-act-now-on-open-data/). Stream is one part of the solution, it brings together 16 water companies to work together to share data openly.
 
Stream is working to stimulate innovation and collaboration through open and shared data. Stream is a unique example of collaboration and open sharing of data across a competitive industry to the benefit of both the companies themselves, as well as society and the environment. Throughout the design process, as well as part of each dataset launch, a high collaborative process is followed, enabling each actor to contribute to the publication of the right data. This process can take time, particularly when it comes to designing [specific standards](https://github.com/icebreakerone/stream-data-standards/blob/working/docs/README.md), however it has significantly increased buy-in from the partner organisations. 

## Sharing data openly across companies
The members of stream have a vision to unlock the potential of water data to benefit customers, society, and the environment, and to use data to address key water sector challenges. Stream is collaboration between 16 water companies based here in the UK, alongside Aiimi, Costain, Icebreaker One, Pinsent Mason, the Open Data Institute and Sia Partners. The project is funded by the Water Breakthrough Challenge, an innovation competition run by water regulator Ofwat. 

The Stream platform is designed to offer clear and accessible access to water-related data for a range of uses, such as research, decision-making, and raising public awareness. Particular challenges which Stream data supports to tackle include preventing environmental incidents, reducing absolute carbon emissions associated with water extraction, use, and treatment and bringing down the cost of water, particularly for the most vulnerable customers. So far the data has been used by a variety of different stakeholders, including academics, journalists and more. 

The process of sharing data to Stream has brought benefits back to the businesses sharing data. While the companies taking part in Stream can choose whether to publish data or not, there are network effects which mean that once some members have blazed a trail and published a certain dataset, the rest tend to follow. For smaller companies, being part of Stream has improved their data maturity, and to publish data which they may not have been able to afford themselves. The initiative has also significantly increased the amount of open data publishing in the water sector, increasing exposure for many of the members to reach wider networks. In one case, the exposure from sharing data via stream led to a tech company [building an AI solution to transform Wessex Waters response to sewage spillages and maintenance](https://www.streamwaterdata.co.uk/apps/eba74286272144db8e513b547771b117/explore). 

## About the data
What began with datasets on water quality has expanded rapidly and there are currently 69 datasets hosted on the [Stream open data portal](https://www.streamwaterdata.co.uk/search?collection=dataset), ranging from [storm overflow activity](https://www.streamwaterdata.co.uk/pages/the-national-storm-overflow-hub), to domestic water consumption, to reservoir levels, with almost all being licenced with the CC-BY 4.0 licence. The datasets are individual to each water company, while maintaining standards across the datasets. This enables both a localised view as well as the ability to compare across locations and companies. One of the most popular datasets is a foundational geospatial dataset which depicts each water company's boundaries. 

One particular challenge that stream faces is the AI readiness of the data. While originally not something that was considered when releasing the data, one of the core benefits of open data is the fact that you don’t know how others will make use of the data. There is work to be done to ensure that data is AI ready, such that additional benefits of opening up water data can be realised for the industry, society and the environment. 

## Looking forward
The data currently being shared on Stream is just the start. There is significant appetite from Stream to continue to expand the data which is shared on the platform, as well as explore how and where the data could be combined with other sources. For example, curating data which can provide insights into how different aspects of the water ecosystem impact the environment, such as the impact of microplastics and forever chemicals in the water system. 

For water companies, one of the benefits of joining Stream is to keep ahead of regulation in the sector, which will continue to impact how the water companies function. The initiative will continue to focus on its core goal of collaboration and connecting people with a common cause. Complex problems in today's world require multi-stakeholder solutions, and bringing people together around data is one way Stream will continue to support people and the planet.
